### 1.2 Executive Summary
*Provide a high-level overview of the project, including its purpose, scope, key objectives, and expected value to the organization. This section should be understandable to executive stakeholders.*

This project supports the bank’s strategic objective of protecting customers, safeguarding revenue, and strengthening trust in its digital payment services by modernizing its credit card fraud detection capabilities. Credit card fraud directly impacts the bank’s financial performance through transaction losses, reimbursement costs, and increased operational and compliance expenses, while also posing a material risk to brand reputation and customer retention. The proposed machine learning–based fraud detection system enables the bank to proactively identify and respond to fraudulent activity in near real time, improving detection accuracy and reducing false positives compared to traditional rule-based approaches. By leveraging scalable data processing and advanced analytics, the solution aligns with the bank’s long-term strategy of data-driven decision-making, operational efficiency, and risk mitigation, while remaining adaptable to evolving fraud patterns. Successful delivery of this project will reduce fraud-related losses, improve customer experience, support regulatory expectations for effective risk controls, and reinforce the bank’s position as a secure and trusted financial services provider.

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Project Summary
*Briefly describe what the project is, why it is being undertaken, and the problem or opportunity it addresses.*

Credit card fraud poses a significant business risk to financial institutions by causing direct financial losses, increasing operational and compliance costs, and damaging customer trust and brand reputation, creating a clear need for more effective and scalable fraud detection solutions. This project proposes the development of a machine learning–based credit card fraud detection system that leverages historical transaction data to identify potentially fraudulent activity in near real time, improving detection accuracy beyond traditional rule-based approaches. The project will involve collecting and preprocessing large-scale transaction datasets, addressing data quality issues and class imbalance, and training supervised learning models such as logistic regression and decision trees, complemented by anomaly detection techniques to capture emerging fraud patterns. The selected and optimized model will be integrated into a real-time transaction evaluation pipeline using industry-standard technologies, including Python-based machine learning libraries and Apache Spark for scalable data processing. Key beneficiaries of this project include fraud prevention and risk management teams, operational and customer service units, executive leadership, and customers, who will benefit from enhanced transaction security, reduced fraud-related losses, and improved confidence in the institution’s financial services, with approval of the Project Charter authorizing the resources required to deliver these outcomes.
